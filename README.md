## Overview

This repository is a culmination of my learning journey through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. Each module includes hands-on projects designed to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, reinforcing the skills necessary for a successful career in cybersecurity.

## Technologies Used

- Google Cloud Platform
- Wireshark
- Python
- Markdown
- Various cybersecurity tools and methodologies

## Modules

### Module 1: Network Security Audit
- **Objective:** Conduct a simulated network security audit to identify vulnerabilities in a companyâ€™s infrastructure.
- **Approach:** Used tools like Nmap and Wireshark to analyze network traffic and assess security controls.
- **Results:** Identified key vulnerabilities and provided recommendations for remediation.
